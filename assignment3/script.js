/* A click action will demonstrate the different characters in Nintendoâ€™s classic games.
 The user will scroll through images and be able to click on the various images similar
  to Instagram and give a like. This aims to connect the characters to the user in an 
  interactive manner. A like is similar to Instagram and other social media when clicking 
  on a photo to like it and then scrolling to see another image. The user can scroll to 
  view another image of a character and then like it again. The idea to click is prompted 
  by the previous knowledge on how to navigate a similar webspace.  This action will allow
   the user to interact with the website producing a greater connection with the characters
    and the website.
